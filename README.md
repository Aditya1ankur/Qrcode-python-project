### Explanation of the Code:

This Python script generates a QR code for a YouTube channel link using the `qrcode` library.

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   ```python
   import qrcode
   import image
   ```
   - `qrcode`: A library used to generate QR codes.
   - `image`: Though imported, it's not required since `qrcode` already handles image generation.

2. **Creating the QR Code Object**:
   ```python
   qr = qrcode.QRCode(
       version=15,
       box_size=10,
       border=5
   )
   ```
   - `version=15`: Specifies the complexity of the QR code. Higher values create larger QR codes.
   - `box_size=10`: Defines the size of each box (or pixel) in the QR code.
   - `border=5`: Sets the width of the white border around the QR code.

3. **Adding Data to the QR Code**:
   ```python
   data = "https://www.youtube.com/adityaankur"
   qr.add_data(data)
   ```
   - The YouTube channel link is embedded into the QR code.

4. **Generating and Saving the QR Code**:
   ```python
   qr.make(fit=True)
   img = qr.make_image(fill='black', back_color='white')
   img.save('youtube_qr.png')
   ```
   - `qr.make(fit=True)`: Ensures the QR code fits the data properly.
   - `make_image()`: Creates the image with a black QR code on a white background.
   - `save()`: Saves the QR code image as `youtube_qr.png`.
